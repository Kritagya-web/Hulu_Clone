# Hulu Clone by Kritagya using ReactJS
This is done in purpose to replicate the Hulu streaming app. It is done just in purpose of learning and implementing things with react. This is a portfolio project that I did most of the parts on my own. Anyway the thing that started off this project was a youtube video from **[Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ)**.

I have deployed this app on firebase at [https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/](https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/).

## What is in it?

- You can surf around the site to find details about your favourite movies.
- Watchlist functionality is there and you can add _yet to be watched_ movies into that list.
- Movies are segregated by various genres and you can look around for movies in whatever genre you prefer.
- There is a search functionality available and don't forget to choose whether you are searching for a movie or a tv show.
- Casting Page is available, just look for the button.
- A search functionality feature for people is available. You can look for a cast member, a director etc.
- When the people search result is available, you can see the movies that the person is known for.
- For TV Shows, extra pages have been added which show the list of seasons and list of episodes.
- Some of your local language movies may be available, try looking for them.

## What's not in it?

- Obviously, you **can't watch** any of the movies or tv shows. This is just a project for my resume.
- The site **hasn't been optimized for mobile view** even a bit, so please don't try seeing this in a mobile view.

Support a fellow developer by giving a **star**, although I feel kind of _cringy_ when asking for it.
